# osx-maintenance 👨🏻‍💻
A simple maintenance script for the average Mac OS X install. I mean, average if you develop software. Runs on the (awesome) Fish shell.

## What it does
- Upgrades all brew packages, including casks [`brew upgrade; brew cask upgrade`]
- Cleans up all brew (and casks) old downloads [`brew cleanup; brew cask cleanup`]
- Deletes a number of generally useless log files, including those generated by Mail and the iOS Simulator.
- Empties the Trash on the main disk
- Deletes the Adobe CC caches
- Deletes any iOS device backup stored on disk
- Deletes Xcode derived files
- Runs `gem cleanup`
- Flushes and empties the disk cache
